I have a script that goes into my gmail and gets an ics file; runs on a cron job.  I've got splunk watching the directory where it is dumped.  I also add other ics files like this one https://www.calendarlabs.com/ical-calendar/ics/76/US_Holidays.ics  .  You can add others you find - just drop them in the same place Splunk is looking for the other ics file.

The icons that go with events seem to create an issue getting dark mode to work.  I'll also likley collapse some of these evals into single lines at some point.
